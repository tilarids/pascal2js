pascal2js is Turbo Pascal to JavaScript translator written in Haskell. 
It supports all kind of pascal expressions and statements(except of the 
goto statement). It also supports additional features to implement 
multitasking. There are some JS runtime files included.

translator parses and completely typechecks pascal project. At the time
of this writing, it is used to translate particular project, and was
not tested on anything else.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
--------------------

* nothing is tested beyond features of particular project, which is not 
  completed, too
* object types of Turbo Pascal 5.5 and later are not supported (but can be
  added later)
* no gotos (not going to be fixed)
* no enumerated types
* support for pointer arithmetics is very poor 
  (because it is normally found in low-level routines which will 
  need to be rewritten by hands anyway).
* tight loops need to be broken in pieces for browser not to hang,
  this is implemented using javascript yield's, whose support in
  browsers is poor, even using google-traceur
* some pchar/string/array_of_char conversions may not always work
* expression parser has some problems with operator precedence (was written
  in a hurry), but luckily it causes typechecker to fail. Adding
  braces helps.

ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATIONS:
---------------------------

* internally, instead of producing javascript AST with type annotations,
  it produces plain strings which makes further JS transformation
  impossible, this is going to be fixed.
* code is raw, programmers are immature

HISTORY
-------

this translator was written short before and during Kharkov DOU Hackaton.

TLDR:
------

this translator is work in progress, and most likely will not do what you want.
